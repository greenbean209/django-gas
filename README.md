# django-gas
This repo explores creating a web app with Django to serve a backend api that returns gas price history, and also serve the frontend html/js

## About
I made this app to test out create a basic webapp using Django. For the sake of having some data source, I'm using pandas datareader to generate a dataframe of gas prices. The goal is to have a backend execute the queries, and have a frontend provide a ui where a user could enter query parameters and display the results. I've also used Django to server the html and js for the frontend.
